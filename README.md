# iA Writer Template Collection

This respository exists to solve an issue which iA Writer seems to have: _a lack of a comprehensive template library._

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! Please make a seperate folder for your template source files and add your template to the `templates` directory. Your template must be bundled as a .aitemplate bundle and should be zipped, so that downloads are easier to manage.
