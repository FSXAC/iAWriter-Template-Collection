# iA Writer Template Collection

This respository exists to solve an issue which iA Writer seems to have: _a lack of a comprehensive template library._

Download the templates you want using the links in the table below. You will get a zip file; unzip it and double-click to install it in iA Writer.

We will have more information on [Github Pages](https://corei8.github.io/iAWriter-Template-Collection/) in the near future; right now we are just working on getting as many templates up as possible.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! Please make a separate folder for your template source files and add your template to the `templates` directory. Your template must be bundled as a .iatemplate bundle and should be zipped, so that downloads are easier to manage.

### How do I make a .iatemplate bundle?

This is something I had no idea how to build when started this project. Turns out it is super easy on Mac, and I am sure that the process is similar on Windows (please correct me if I am wrong). You have to make sure that your file structure is the same as the template you used as a base (assuming that your template is a modification of someone elses) or else it has to meet the criterion indicated on the [official template-building page](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates). Change the name of the folder containing the `Contents` folder, or your project root folder, by adding `.iatemplate`. You have just created a bundle. Now turn it into a zip file and upload it to this repository.

### Shoud I make a license for my template?

Yes. I recommend that you host the template in your own repository, where it can be fixed ir updated if need be, and use the MIT license.

### Do I need to supply a screenshot?

Not necessarily. I will prepare screenshots for every template that does not come with one. If the image is not of good quality or is otherwise lacking, I will make a screenshot myself.
