# Templates for iA Writer

Here is the beginning of a collection of templates for iA Writer. Our goal is to collect as many templates as we can, license depending, and also make our own. iA Writer does not appear to have a library of templates -- and even the three that you can find on their sight, though good, are nothing special. Hopefully, all the writers out there who are held back by this lack of rendering possibilities will be helped by this collection.

## Contributing

Contributions are very [simple](https://github.com/corei8/iAWriter-Template-Collection#contributing) and are most welcome! Pleae see the official [template page](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates) for more information. I hope to have my own guide soon, but that may take some time to make well.

## Templates

Unfortunately I do not anticipate ordering the templates in any way shape or form in the near or even distant future. Please bring it up in the [issues](https://github.com/corei8/iAWriter-Template-Collection/issues) if you really want an order.
